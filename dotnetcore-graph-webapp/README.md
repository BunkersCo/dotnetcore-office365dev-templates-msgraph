## Overview

This project template can help you quickly set up an ASP.NET website and call the Microsoft Graph service as a user, implementing the following three functions:

1. Read the basic information of the current user
1. Read the first ten messages in the current user's mailbox inbox (Exchange Online)
1. Read the list of files under the root directory of the current user's OneDrive for Business

The template supports both ``global`` and ``gallatin`` versions.

## Prerequisites

In order to use this template, you'd better be able to register an application yourself. If you are not familiar with this concept, please refer to the description of [Microsoft Graph overview] (https://github.com/chenxizhang/office365dev/blob/master/docs/microsoftgraphoverview.md).

If you need to access the ``global`` version of Office 365, it is recommended that you directly use the AAD 2.0 registration method to register at <https://apps.dev.microsoft.com>. Please refer to [this article] (https://github) .com/chenxizhang/office365dev/blob/master/docs/applicationregisteration2.0.md).

If you need to access the ``gallatin`` version of Office 365, you can only use the AAD 1.0 registration method to register at <https://portal.azure.cn>, please refer to [this article] (https://github. Com/chenxizhang/office365dev/blob/master/docs/applicationregisteration.md).

This template example requires at least three delegated permissions

1. Files.Read.All
1. Mail.Read
1. User.Read

Regardless of which method you use for registration, please set Reply Url to <http://localhost:5000/signin-odic>.

## How to install the template

You can install this template through `dotnet new -i chenxizhang.dotnetcore.msgraph.webapp.CSharp`.

## How to use the template

There are several scenarios for this template, as follows

1. The simplest usage of `dotnet new graphwebapp` will create a template implementation, and you will use the clientid I ​​created in advance to access Office 365 International.
1. By explicitly specifying the `clientid` and `secret` parameter, explicitly use your application to access Office 365. This is my most recommended, the syntax is `dotnet new graphwebapp --clientid' the-applicationid-you-created --secret your-secret`.
1. With the `instance` parameter, specify whether you want to access the ``global`` or ``gallatin`` version. The ``global`` version is the default, and if you want to specify the ``gallatin`` version, you need to use the following syntax: `dotnet new graphwebapp --instance gallatin --clientid the-applicationid-you-created --secret your-secret`.
1. Specify the version of the Graph API you want to access via the `version` parameter. The default is `v1.0`. Currently `beta` is also supported.

There are also two common parameters

1. By specifying `name` you can change the name of the project generated by the template, as well as the default namespace name. For example, `dotnet new graphwebapp -n mynamespace`.
1. You can specify to generate a new project directory by specifying `output`. For example, `dotnet new graphwebapp -o test`.

Once the project is created, you can run it directly from `dotnet run` or edit it in `Visual Studio Code` and run it again. You can access the three default features through the following address:

1. Read the current user's basic information (<http://localhost:5000>)
1. Read the first ten messages in the current user's mailbox (Exchange Online) (<http://localhost:5000/messages>)
1. Read the list of files under the root directory of the current user's OneDrive for Business (<http://localhost:5000/files>)

## How to uninstall the template
